# Exam Paper Platform

## Overview

An intelligent exam paper generation system that uses Graph RAG to create high-quality exam questions based on syllabus, previous year questions (PYQs), and domain knowledge.

**Pipeline:**
```
Syllabus (what can be asked)
↓
PYQs (what has been asked)
↓
Graph RAG (what should be asked)
↓
LLM (how it is worded)
```

## 🎯 Features

### Multi-Subject Support
- **Question Generation**: ✅ All 7 subjects supported
  - EE (Electrical Engineering)
  - CS (Computer Science)
  - CE (Civil Engineering)
  - EC (Electronics & Communication)
  - ME (Mechanical Engineering)
  - CH (Chemical Engineering)
  - MT (Metallurgical Engineering)

- **Answer Generation**: ⚡ Currently EE only (expandable)
  - Uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with Pinecone vector store
  - LLM-powered detailed solutions with LaTeX math support
  - Context-aware answers from embedded textbooks

### Core Capabilities
- Neo4j graph database for syllabus and PYQ relationships
- Smart question distribution (frequency, recency, never-asked)
- LangGraph-based question generation workflow
- FastAPI REST API
- PDF generation for exam papers
- Question validation and verification

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Generate Questions (Any Subject)

```bash
# Electrical Engineering (with answers)
python scripts/generate_exam_with_answers.py generate \
  --subject "EE 2026" --total 10

# Computer Science (questions only)
python scripts/generate_exam_with_answers.py generate \
  --subject "CS 2026" --total 10

# See all options
python scripts/generate_exam_with_answers.py --help
```

### API Usage

```bash
# List all subjects
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/exam/subjects

# Generate questions for any subject
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/exam/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"subject": "CS 2026", "total_questions": 10, "cutoff_year": 2023}'

# Generate answers (EE only)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/exam/answers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"questions": [...], "subject": "EE 2026"}'
```

```

## 📖 Examples

### Run Interactive Demo
```bash
python3 examples/demo_multi_subject.py
```

### Generate Exam for Multiple Subjects
```bash
subjects=("EE 2026" "CS 2026" "CE 2026")
for subject in "${subjects[@]}"; do
  python scripts/generate_exam_with_answers.py generate \
    --subject "$subject" --total 10 --output "output/${subject// /_}"
done
```
